Super Mario World Widescreen
============================

**Super Mario World Widescreen** is your beloved Mario World
SNES game but in the 16:9 resolution. This is possible by expanding
the horizontal resolution by 96 pixels, increasing resolution from
256x224 to 352x224. Since the original SNES does not have this
resolution, the emulator focused into high definition mods **bsnes-hd**
must be used.

## Supported screens

Currently SMW Widescreen supports 16:9 and 16:10 monitor resolutions.
More aspect ratios are planned and are currently work in progress,
namely 2:1 and 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratios.

All aspect ratio has the intended 8:7 pixel aspect ratio from the original
SNES Picture Processing Unit. This means that the screen you will see is
like how would you see on a real TV screen connected to the SNES, except
expanded to the widescreen resolution!

## IMPORTANT

- You **must** play with bsnes_hd. You can download it here: https://github.com/DerKoun/bsnes-hd/releases
or look for "bsnes-hd beta" core on RetroArch.
- For copyright reasons, the ROM is not provided. You will have to obtain on your own
ways the original Super Mario World (USA) ROM and apply the BPS patch over it.
- See https://sneslab.net/wiki/How_to_apply_ROM_patches how to apply BPS patches.
- The BSO file **must stay in the same folder as the patched ROM file** and **copy have the same file name as the ROM file**. Otherwise, the widescreen settings will not load on bsnes_hd or RetroArch and you will see a completely oval title screen opening circle. Example: "SMW.bso" and "SMW.smc"
- In case you can't get the BSO file working, you can open it using a text editor and manually apply the widescreen settings on bsnes_hd settings.
